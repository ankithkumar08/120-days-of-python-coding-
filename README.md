# 120 Days of Python Coding Challenge

Welcome to my **120 Days of Python Coding Challenge** repository! üöÄ

## Overview

This repository serves as a daily log of my journey through Python programming. Over the next 120 days, I will tackle various coding challenges, explore new concepts, and create projects to enhance my skills. The goal is to build a strong foundation in Python and data engineering principles.

## What to Expect

- **Daily Challenges:** Each day's challenge will focus on a specific Python concept or problem.
- **Code Examples:** Solutions will include clear, well-documented code snippets.
- **Projects:** Mini-applications and projects demonstrating practical applications of Python.
- **Learning Resources:** Links to tutorials, documentation, and articles related to the topics covered.

## Structure

The repository is organized by day, with each day's folder containing:
- `day_x.py`: The main Python script for that day's challenge.
- `README.md`: A brief overview of the day's challenge and key takeaways.
- Any additional resources or files needed for that day.

## How to Contribute

Feel free to fork the repository and add your own challenges or improvements! Contributions are welcome, and I appreciate any feedback.
